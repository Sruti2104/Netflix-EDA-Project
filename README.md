PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project performs an interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applies a Machine Learning algorithm on the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.
Users can explore the dataset dynamically by:
1. Viewing total Movies and TV Shows
2. Listing titles released in a specific year
3. Counting content by country
4. Searching for a Movie or TV Show by title
In addition to data exploration, the project now includes a Logistic Regression model that predicts whether a given title is a Movie or a TV Show based on its features.
This demonstrates both data analysis and machine learning implementation using Python.

TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Scikit-learn (for Logistic Regression)

DATASET:
File: netflix_titles.csv
Source: [Kaggle - Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)

HOW TO RUN:
1. Place netflix_titles.csv in the same folder as the Python script.
2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Run the Python script:
   python netflix_eda.ipynb
4. Follow the interactive menu to explore the dataset.
